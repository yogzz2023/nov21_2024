replace matplotlib plotting with pyqtgraph plotting 
in plot tab i need some sub tabs which will have have option to select type of plots (search plot , track plot )
to configure the window size of the plots ( like we can enter  max range min range, max azimuth , min azimuth , max elevation , min elevation and max time and min time )
so plots should adjust according to that 

a option to chaneg size of the marker (small , medium and big)

do these changes and give me the updated code 


in plot tab i need some sub tabs which will have have option to select type of plots (search plot , track plot )
and also add a data tip so on keeping the cursor on the point i should get the values (of the x and y values which is on the plot )
also fix the grids for all plots for track ids also and all plot options 
do these changes and give me the updated full code after all the integration 


in the plot tab 
1)i want to add a drop down for plotting types of plots (plot types)
-range vs time 
-azimuth vs time 
-elevation vs time
-ppi
-rhi
-all modes 
2)i want to add a drop down for plot colors (which should have multiple colors)
3) i want to add a drop down for plot size (which should have 3 options of 3 size (small,medium,big))
4)pop up for subplots ( 2 subplots m 3 subplots) - functionality is give a option to select which subplots to plot 
5)a pop up so on click i can do the plot configuration 
to enter max and min - (range,azimuth,elevation and time) so based on this input the plot should adjust 
6)a option to view the history of the plot (track id)

so do these changes to my code and integrate it to my code

so after doing this changes and give full code 

plot type,plot color ,pot size, plot configurtion (all these shoudl come under tge plot tab )

so change according to that and give me the updated code
